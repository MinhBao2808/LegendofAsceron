UPDATE 1.01 - 26/10/2018
* Added Param to store Camera, instead of using Camera.Main
* Changed Horizontal / Vertical names to Forward / Back Left / Right
* Changed so it will only show orthographic / perspective options if the camera is set to which state
* Added option to follow target (Target follow speed is set with Speed)
* Increased default min/max values



How to Setup!
1. Add script to your Main Camera, and make sure it's tagged as 'MainCamera'
2. Create or apply the Demo Camera Profile to the Camera Controller script on your MainCamera (this is so we can set the Camera min, max values at runtime!)
3. Might be a good idea to set all values to their max values, to allow you freedom of movement while you set the values.
4. Now run your scene and begin will height, as this is will impact the min, max up/down left/right positions.
5. Now move all the way to one side and copy the Cameras transform value and enter into the representing min/max range.
6. once all are set REMEMBER TO SAVE TO PROFILE!
7. Now next time you load all min/max positions should be correct.
